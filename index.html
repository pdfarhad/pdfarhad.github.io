        <h1>Hi there!</h1>
        <p>
          My name is <strong>Farhad Alam Bhuiyan</strong>. I’m a
          <i>wanna be</i> Data Scientist and Backend Engineer living in,
          Dhaka.<br />
          Currently, I am Leading the Data Science and Engineering team at
          <strong>Shohoz</strong> I have a solid
          <strong>8 years of Industrial experiences</strong> and
          <strong>4 years of Research and Teaching experiences</strong>.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
		  While working in <strong>Dohatec</strong>, I had an accidental connection with a startup http://intelligentmachin.es and they offered me a part-time Team Lead position for their new Product.
		  
		  It was an intense and interesting project to work with in a very short
          period of time. Lead a small Agile team to Design and Code. Deployed a
          mobile based app and a Data Driven Dashboard for bKash Merchandisers
          to do their Daily Activities. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.retail.biponon&hl=en" Moble App/>
		  https://bkash.retaildata.xyz.
		  Daily at least 20k pictures are uploaded
          in the server from the app to go under a CNN model for Data Driven
          analysis and reporting.
        </p>
        <p>
          In <strong>Dohatec</strong>, my team was responsible for building a
          data visualization tool for the end users to visualize and interact
          their data. We used <i>bleeding edge</i> technologies like
          <i>python, Django, Typescript, Angular6, D3js</i> and designed a
          microservice architecture. We used our custom ETL code to structure
          the unstructured data and stored in a NoSQL database and made an API
          to access it from our application. We had a Beta release on November,
          2016.<br />
          Before serving <strong>Dohatec New Media</strong> for last couple of
          years as a team lead; I have worked in few startup companies where I
          built games and mobile applications. There I worked with different
          languages and frameworks like-
          <i>C++, C#, python, Javascript, ObjectiveC, Android, Unity3d</i>. I
          get pretty enthusiastic about making sure things are organized, and I
          believe in constantly challenging myself to embrace new learning
          experiences. <br />
          Oh, I got a Bachelor Degree in
          <strong>Computer Science and Engineering</strong> from
          <strong>University of Dhaka</strong>.<br />
          I love to solve problems. I'm never happier than when I can dig into a
          problem and find a solution to make somebody's life a little bit
          better. That's the great thing about software engineering - it's all
          about solving people's problems.
          <br />

          I want to treat every person I meet in such a way that I would want to
          be treated. I refuse to pursue anything that is unethical,
          questionable, or doesn’t “sit right” with my insides; That’s a big
          deal to me.<br />
          <br />
          That’s just a little bit about me. I hope I have the opportunity to
          learn a little bit about you! Drop me a line at
