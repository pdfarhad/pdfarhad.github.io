        		<h1>Hi there!</h1>
				<p>My name is <strong>Farhad Alam Bhuiyan</strong>. I’m a  Software Engineer and <i>wanna be</i> Data Scientist living in, Dhaka.<br>

In my 5 years Job experience, before serving <strong>Dohatec New Media</strong> for last couple of years as a team leader; I have worked in few startup companies where I built game and mobile applications. I get pretty enthusiastic about making sure things are organized, and I believe in constantly challenging myself to embrace new learning experiences.
					<br> Oh, I got a Bachelor Degree in <strong>Computer Science and Engineering</strong> from <strong>University of Dhaka</strong>.<br>
I love to solve problems. I'm never happier than when I can dig into a problem and find a solution to make somebody's life a little bit better. That's the great thing about software development - it's all about solving people's problems.
<br>
<br>
More than the techy stuff I do, I mostly want to be known as <strong>Nishi’s husband</strong>, <strong>Farhana’s Son</strong>, and an all-out follower of <strong>Muhammad(عليه السلام)</strong>.<br>
I love to watch anime, love to travel, love to explore new things And yes I love to Eat :D :D<br>
 I want to treat every person I meet in such a way that I would want to be treated. I refuse to pursue anything that is unethical, questionable, or just doesn’t “sit right” with my insides; But I’ve always had a wild imagination, if you know what I mean. That’s a big deal to me.<br>
<br>
That’s just a little bit about me. I hope I have the opportunity to learn a little bit about you! Drop me a line at <strong>farhad.alam.bhuiyan@gmail.com</strong>
